# CMPE-256-515K-Hotel-Reviews-Analysis

#### Data Source : https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe/data

### Overview: 
 ##### Motivation: 
A lot of analytics projects explore various aspects of hotel reviews like top hotels in a city or some other insights like popularity over time. However, we have observed that the hotel reviews dataset has seldom been analyzed from the perspective of a user’s and reviewers’ nationality. Analysis done based on the nationality of the user and the reviewer can unveil interesting insights like which country has the greatest number of reviewers, are these reviews generally positive or negative etc. Another interesting insight is reviewers of which countries generally provide similar types of reviews. All these factors form the motivation to carry out this project.
##### Objectives:
- Analyze the dataset with a focus on the reviewers’ nationality.
- Develop a recommendation system which gives a list of recommended hotels based on user’s hotel selection.
- Develop a system which accepts nationality and city name as user input and gives a list of hotel suggestions based on reviews given by users of that nationality. Upon selection of a hotel the system then recommends similar hotels across Europe.
